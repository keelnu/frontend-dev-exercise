<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A sample sign-up page UI implemented using React. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To view the HTML/CSS-only version of the app, within src/html-only, right-click on index.html within VS Code and select "Open with Live Server".

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/frontend-dev-exercise.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Runs the app in development mode.

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
   The page will reload if you make edits.\
   You will also see any lint errors in the console.

4. Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
   The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
